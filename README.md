# Welcome to BottAll :leaves:
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h6VypWs.png" width="300" float="center"></p><br>

Hello there!
This is **BottAll**,  a University Buisness Plan project created by some students of the master course of Electric Vehicle Engineering at [MUNER  University](https://motorvehicleuniversity.com).
Our idea won the first price at [**Bologna  Startup  Prize**  **chap V**  **2020**](https://www.facebook.com/bolognastartup): our buisness plan expressed the best growth potential above all, and it was particularly appreciated dueto its feasibility.

## What is the aim of this project :thinking:
BottAll was born as a project for the exam of the course of *Laboratory of Business Plan M*.
Starting from the idea of a new product which could be competitive on the market, we had to create a buisness plan around it. At the end of the course, we presented the whole project to our peers, the Professor and some experts in startups.

## What is BottAll? :fork_and_knife:
As the name can suggest, BottAll is an all-in-one packet lunch mate: it is a "bottle" composed by two part:

 - **Water can**: that can contain up to 0.5l of thermally insulated liquid;
 - **Food container**: with a capacity of 0.45l, it can contain food and it has also an integrated circuit that allows a connection with the smartphone. It can be plug with a usb-c charger to warm up the food.

More details can be found on the buisness plan or in our presentation.

## Why here on github? :octocat:
We think it is the best place to share our work, to the Open Source community, and to everyone who is interested in new engineering and design challenges.

## How to compile the latex package:
Please use **LuaLatex**.
###  note :exclamation: 
We don't really know why, but the compiler is giving an error about the *'caption' package*, here it is the log:

```plaintext
! Package caption Error: hang undefined.
See the caption package documentation for explanation.
Type H <return> for immediate help.
...
l.33 \DeclareCaptionFormat
{upper}{#1#2\uppercase{#3}\par}
If you do not understand this error, please take a closer look
at the documentation of the `caption' package, especially the
section about errors.
```
Despite this, the output pdf should look normal, so you can neglect it.
